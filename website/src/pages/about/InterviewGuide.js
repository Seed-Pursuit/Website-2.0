          Before your interview, we recommend watching a video by one of our seasoned Group Partners. This
          video provides insights into what to expect during your interview and what separates successful
          presentations from the rest.

          How to Prepare for Your Seed Pursuit Interview
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-left text-black">
          As our interviews are brief, there's little time for small talk or formal presentations. We
          focus on two things: asking you questions and examining what you've accomplished so far.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="">
        <p className="text-[45px] text-left text-[#f32e7d]">
          Avoid Over-Preparation
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-left text-black">
          Contrary to popular belief, extensive interview preparation often does more harm than good. It's
          unnecessary and can make interviews feel forced and awkward. We want genuine conversations, not
          rehearsed speeches or slide presentations.

          Show Progress
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-left text-black">
          To maximize your chances at Seed Pursuit, focus on making progress with your startup between the
          time you applied and the interview. Whether you've launched, improved your product, or increased
          revenue, demonstrating your ability to move swiftly and make significant strides is a surefire
          way to impress our interviewers.

          Describe your startup clearly
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-left text-black">
          The first question we usually ask is, "What is your company working on?" Provide a
          straightforward, jargon-free description of your startup. Remember, we appreciate startups that
          teach us something new, even if it's industry-specific.

            It's helpful to have key metrics written down for quick reference during the interview. While

            Don't hesitate to discuss the challenges your startup faces. We appreciate candid
            conversations about obstacles more than dismissive or overconfident responses. All startups
            encounter difficulties; pretending they don't exist won't work in your favor.

            We don't expect you to have all the answers, so if you encounter an unexpected question, take

          Be prepared to provide a demonstration of your product. By "demo," we mean a functional version
          of what you've built or plan to build. Have it ready for a screenshare if it's software, or
          physically present if it's hardware. If neither is feasible, ensure you have a demo video on
          hand.
